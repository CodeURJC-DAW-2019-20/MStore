In the lower part the <b>total of the purchase is shown</b> and will give the possibility of <b>adding more items</b> to the cart or checkout.
  </p>

  ### 8. SELLER'S VIEW

## **Phase 3: REST API to the web application and deployment with docker.**

### Building the image

To create the image, we have provided the file script.bat. Don't forget to edit it and change {{path}} for the corresponding absolute path. You should also change "nmartinezs2017/webapp10" to the name of the image you want.

### Executing the dockerized application

Go to the "backend / docker" directory to execute the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```
